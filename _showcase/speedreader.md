## Background

Speed reading is a techniqe that involves moving the eyes quickly across a page, training the eyes to see larger chunks of text at a time.

## Purpose of this project

This program's purpose is to help users practice eye movements for speed reading.
It does this by chunking a passage into small groups of words and displaying those chunks on different parts of the screen.
Each chunk is displayed for only a short time before it is hidden and the next chunk displayed.
This helps the reader to practice seeing larger chunks at once and moving their eyes in larger distances between chunks.
